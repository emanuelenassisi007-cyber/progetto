A lightweight, privacy-focused **Fitness Tracker** web application. It allows users to log their daily calorie intake, track weight fluctuations, calculate their Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR), and visualize their weight journey over time.

##  How It Works (Under the Hood)

### 1. BMR Calculation
The app calculates your recommended daily calories based on the **Mifflin-St Jeor** formula:

*   **Men:** $BMR = 10 \times \text{weight (kg)} + 6.25 \times \text{height (cm)} - 5 \times \text{age (years)} + 5$
*   **Women:** $BMR = 10 \times \text{weight (kg)} + 6.25 \times \text{height (cm)} - 5 \times \text{age (years)} - 161$

### 2. Custom Canvas Graph
Instead of loading heavy charting libraries, the application maps the minimum and maximum logged weights directly to the pixel coordinates of an HTML5 `<canvas>`, drawing an optimized vector line trend.

- [ ]  **Dark Mode:** Add a modern dark theme toggle.
- [ ]  **Data Management:** Add a button to delete specific entries or clear the entire history.
- [ ]  **Advanced Graphics:** Add grid lines and dates to the canvas chart axes.
